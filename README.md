Making an intuitive system for efficient contact management is the main goal of this project. 
The system offers user control and data security choices in addition to trying to make adding, 
changing, and removing contacts easier by using different types of data structures and 
algorithms.
The developed data structures support storing, maintaining, and retrieving contacts
inside the contact book application and include a hash, a doubly linked list, a queue, two stacks, 
and an implicit binary search tree# -Contact-Book
